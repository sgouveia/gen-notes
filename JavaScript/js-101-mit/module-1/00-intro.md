## Intro

This course intends to be as much an introduction to the JavaScript programming language as an overview of basic principles of programming. Maybe even more of the latter. Programming is the process of creating a computer program. And a program is a set of instructions telling a computer what to do. Most of the time, this is done with a specific programming language, an artificial construct that someone built, with its own rules of syntax and grammar. There was a time when this was the only way to interact with a computer, through words and phrases combined, sometimes in new and creative ways. Programming is a way of thinking about a problem. It involves understanding the problem, planning, coding, and testing. Coding is the task of writing the text that makes up a program.
