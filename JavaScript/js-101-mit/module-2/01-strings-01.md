## Strings

We can do a lot in programming just with numbers. In fact, your computer will be more comfortable with numbers than with any other data type (there's another data type that is even closer to the machine, but we'll get to that later).

Humans, however, have a more difficult time communicating solely through numbers. That's where text comes in.

In JavaScript, text is represented by strings. A string is a sequence of characters and they're written by enclosing its content with quotes, double quotes, or backticks.

```js
"My favourite movie is Double Indemnity" // these are double quotes
'Really? I prefer Singles' // these are single quotes
`I cannot find any film which mentions backticks` // and these are backticks
```

You can use whichever you prefer as long as you open and close the string with the same one. In fact, it is a good practice to be consistent within your whole code and use the same everywhere. But that's up to you.
