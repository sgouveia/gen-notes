# just

`just` is a command runner that helps you automate project tasks by creating simple scripts or recipes in a `justfile`. It’s like a more modern `Makefile` for handling repetitive tasks like running scripts, managing environments, building your project, or anything else you'd automate.

Here’s what `just` does:
- **Defines tasks**: You create a `justfile` where you can define commands like installing dependencies, running tests, starting servers, etc.
- **Simplifies repetitive actions**: It’s great for defining common project workflows. For example, you can have commands like `just run` or `just test` to perform repetitive tasks with a single command.
