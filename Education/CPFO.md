## the premise

Same input
- noobs
- no previous experience in programming

Same output
- able to start a career as a full-stack developer
- understanding their own knowledge in a way that allows them to continue their learning journey by themselves

New variables:
- Integrate learners who can't leave their jobs (part-time)
- Integrate learners who can't move to Lisbon or Porto (remote)

Nice-to-haves:
- Less dependency on teacher-hours
- Less dependency on physical classrooms

## the problems

- The on-site lecture is one of the major strenghts of the bootcamp methodology. The pandemic experience taught us that we can't have "ted-talks" through a camera and expect learners to focus the same way. Or at all.
- Also, remote lectures, being naturally recorded, my work as an incentive for learners to miss the live sessions and watch them in their own time and pace. Or not watch them at all.
- The one-on-one experience is clanky on remote. A conversation that takes 2 minutes on-site is at least ten via zoom. And it's a frustrating one.
- Camaraderie - a vital point within on-site bootcamps, is harder to achieve via remote call.
- Without supervision, learners may not engage in the coding assignments 

## the goal

 - Reduce live-sessions to the minimum (6 hours per week) and lecture the less we can.
 - Learners should work on their own, taking advantage of their peers to solve coding problems, and less on teachers.
 - So: no lectures. No one-on-ones. 

## the proposal

 - The unit that acts as the building block of the CPFO is one week. The week's structure repeats itself over the 25 weeks.
