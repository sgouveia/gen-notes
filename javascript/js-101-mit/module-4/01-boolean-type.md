## Boolean Values

Now, probably the simplest JavaScript data type, but a very powerful one: the boolean.

Contrary to numbers or strings, which can assume billions of different values, the boolean comes with the great comfort of having two, and only two, possibilities:

Yes or no; on or off; true or false; one or zero; do or do not.

It just takes one question to be sure which boolean value a variable is holding Are you not on? Then you must be off. 

The literal representation of these two values in JavaScript is as follows:

```js
true;
false;
```

Just like that. No quotes whatsoever. If you need to assign a boolean to a variable, this is how you'll do it.

```js
let myBoolean = true;
```

Don't underestimate the power of a simple true or false statement. The world of computation is built on binary logic. Now, the _real_ fun begins.

### Practice

Which of the following variables contains a boolean value?
1.
```js
let a = true;
```
2.
```js
let a = 'true';
```
3.
```js
let a = yes;
```
4.
```js
let a = 1;
```
