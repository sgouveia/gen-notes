## numbers

*Inside* a computer, there's only data represented by ones and zeros. Everything is ones and zeros. Words, numbers, images, sounds, and much more, are stored as ones and zeros. When programming you won't need to reason this way. All programming languages define several types of **values**, and when learning a new language, this is probably the first thing you need to look up. What types of **values** are built into the language?

We've used sentences and words in the previous lessons, this is one type of value called `String`. We'll get back to it further along this course, but for now, let's focus on numeric values.

Many other languages define lots of types for their numbers, but not JavaScript. There's only one type of numeric type and it's called `Number`. We represent it purely by writing it, without any quotation marks, like this:

```js
9
```

Just by doing this, somewhere in your computer memory the number 9 will be stored in memory. This is not very useful, but we could print a number to the console. If you need a negative value, you just use the minus sign before it. For a fractional number, use a dot.

```js
console.log(9);
console.log(-9);
console.log(3.14);
```
