## variables

Earlier when we declared a value like this, we told you it was stored in memory by JavaScript:

```js
9;
```

Space was allocated in memory in order to store the number 9. But you won't be able to access that memory space and read the value saved there. We use variables for this. We use variables with meaningful and expressive names that can represent anything you want. A player's name, year of birth, credit card number, or the maximum speed of a car. Some high score, or use two variables for the latitude and longitude of a GPS location.

Simply put, you'll use variables to store any value you need to remember and use or change at a later moment in time.

Let's start with a very common statement where we'll create a variable and store some value in it.

```js
let myAge = 25;
```
