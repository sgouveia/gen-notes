## the remainder operator

Another arithmetic operator quite used in programming may be less familiar to you: the remainder, represented by the `%` symbol. It gives you the remainder of a division between two numbers.

```js
38 % 10; // produces the value 8
21 % 3 // produces 0
```

There are a lot of applications for this operator besides simply finding the remainder of a division. For example, determining if some number is even or odd. Try thinking about how you could use this operator to do so.
